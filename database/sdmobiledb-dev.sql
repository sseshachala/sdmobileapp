INSERT INTO `sd_doc_details` VALUES (1,'The right kind of food, a simple lifestyle and the right agricultural practices.\r\nThere are thousands of Diabetics with gangrenous legs who consider Dr Khadar Valli a messiah for saving their limbs after they were advised to go for amputation.\r\nMysuru : This \'doc\' in desi khadi does no black magic - instead he advises changes in food choices and minimal medication at a minimal cost to the hundreds of patients at his doors and ends up delivering a miracle.\r\nThe right kind of food, a simple lifestyle and the right agricultural practices. That\'s all society needs to mend its ways and get itself into top health says Dr Khadar Valli, a US returned scientist, who has dedicated his life of building a healthy society after resigning from a lucrative job in an MNC.\r\nThe 60-year-old scientist is the perfect \'physician\' for extremely complicated situations. There was a case of two young lovers, who had attempted suicide by consuming poison after their parents refused to allow them to marry. They ended up bedridden with a nervous breakdown at KR Hospital in Mysuru and a week later, came to him and fell at his feet. Then there are thousands of Diabetics with gangrenous legs who consider him a messiah for saving their limbs after they were advised to go for amputation. And there are epileptics who have lost all hope, who rush to his residence in the interior of TK Layout here for deliverance from the malady. He has not disappointed any of them.\r\nThere is a sea of patients at his residence, he treats at least 100 a day in TK layout from Tuesday to Saturday, and over 200 at Bidarahalli in HD Kote taluk every Monday.\r\nThe son of Husenamma and Husenappa, natives of Proddatur (Kadapa Dist) in Andhra Pradesh and resident of Mysuru, Dr Khadar did his BSc.Ed and MSc.Ed from Regional College of Education, Mysuru and PhD at Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. He has worked as a post doctoral fellow on Environmental Science at Beaverton Oregon and as scientist in CFTRI for two years. Joining Dupont, he worked for 4 and a half years in the US and in India for a year, before settling in Mysuru in 1997.\r\nSaving the soil for posterity is another passion of his. Dr Khadar feels it will happen only with the right kind of agricultural practices. He is worried that with the kind of crop practices farmers are adopting, the soil may become unfit to grow anything in the next thirty years.\r\nThe increasing cases of juvenile diabetes, childhood obesity, early puberty, irregular menstrual cycles, polycystic ovaries, infertility, anaemia, low milk supply during breast feeding and constipation-what does he blame them on? Diet counselors may say it\'s all because of chocolates, pizzas and your love for non-vegetarian food but Dr Khadar does not feel this is entirely true. \"Oxtocin/estrogen hormones are injected into cows to increase milk yield, micro levels of those hormones present in milk is one reason for early puberty in girls. Alloxan, used as a bleaching agent to bleach wheat flour for production of maida (used for preparing bakery products), obstructs the capacity of the pancreas to produce beta cells, which store and release insulin,\" he points out.\r\n\"Start eating positive siridhanya grains (millets) which we used to eat 60 years ago. These include Foxtail (Navane), Barnyad (Oodalu), Kodo (Arka), Little (Saame), Brown Top (Korle), fruits\r\n \r\nand vegetables, palm jaggery (Kappu bella/saate) and use groundnut oil to stay healthy. Positive siridhanya grains (millets) are not just nutritious, they can be grown in dry land and need only 20 cm of rainfall. As high as 60 percent of the available land in India is dry land. So if farmers cultivate positive siridhanya grains (millets), there can be no drought in the next 50 years,\" he reasons.\r\nAnd the healthy alternative to chocolates? \"Give sweet balls prepared from groundnut, til (sesame seeds) jaggery and coconut to kids. Coca used for making chocolate has theobromine, an alkaloid similar to nicotin in tobacco, which causes an addiction, if taken for 21 days. The pink skin of peanut (groundnuts) is rich in anti-oxidants which can fight cancer and other diseases. Til can improve the development of the brain,\" he says.\r\nDr Khadar grows as many as 38 crop varieties including positive siridhanya grains (millets) and he uses `Kaadu Chaitanya Dravana,\' a microbial liquid for farming in his 7 acres of dry land in Bidarahalli in HD Kote Taluk. He even gives a live demo on the right agricultural practices at his farm. His daughter Dr Sarala, a homeopath and wife Usha, have been partnering Dr Khadar in his cause.\r\nGrowing Sugar Cane to produce one kg of sugar, 28,000 liters of water is needed, to grow one kg of rice, 8,000 liters is required, to grow 1 kg wheat 9,000 liters of water is needed, to grow 1 kg of meat 50,000 liters of water is required, but to grow one kg of positive siridhanya grains (millets) 300 litres water is sufficient. Food which takes a longer period to dislodge the sugar (glucose and fructose) to be absorbed by the blood, is the right kind of food. Ragi takes one and a half to two hours, positive siridhanya grains (millets) take over 6 hours while rice takes just 45 minutes to get absorbed in the blood increasing the risk of diabetes.\r\nA herbicide present in Soyabean leads to Cancer. Steriods are being injected to increase the weight of goat, sheep, chicken and pigs.\r\nGluten present in wheat may affect the absorption of micro nutrients like zinc in the small intestine.\r\nDill leaves (Sabsige Soppu), garlic and the white part of Castor fruit can improve breast milk production when taken in the right quantity.\r\nTags : medication, physician Location: India, Karnataka, Mysuru.\r\n\r\nBe Innocent and Honest with Good Manners, Life Sings Beautiful Tunes in it\'s Own Way\r\n','https://static.wixstatic.com/media/0d315f_9ee15dbadf3044b1aa2dd601263c4e95~mv2.jpg');

A gluten-free alternative to couscous and pasta, millet is incredibly easy to make.\r\n\r\n\r\nEver heard of millet? I hadn’t, until we started getting into whole grains. Millet tends to take a back seat to the fancier-sounding trendy whole grains like quinoa. On a whim, we recently bought some with no idea what to expect. We were both pleasantly surprised with the result – instead of being extra chewy like most whole grains, millet has a light, almost couscous-like texture! I was excited to learn that it cooks in just 20 minutes, which is half the time of brown rice. (While our package instructions said to cook for 35 to 40 minutes, we found it needed much less time.)\r\n\r\n','sudhi','sudhi@email.com','https://ob8qxdtnu3-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_9165-3.jpg','how to cook millets?','https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJV_J4XKfls',NULL),(2,'recipe','The food that we are consuming today can be best described as \"Notion of Food\".\r\nThen, what is the food we should consume? Siridhanya, commonly called Millets. They are small grains which grow without the help of pesticides, fertilisers and harvests with very little water. They are - Kodo Millet (Aarka), Foxtail Millet (Navane), Barnyard Millet (Oodalu), Green Millet / Browntop Millet (Korle), Little Millet (Saame).\r\nAs recently as about 50 years ago genetically modified Paddy Rice and Wheat were developed in laboraties and have been promoted with great enthusiasm in the name of Green Revolution. So much so that it is difficult to imagine life without them now!\r\n\r\n \r\nThen, what is wrong with consuming the present day Paddy Rice and Wheat? Water has to stand around the crop for Rice and Wheat to grow. This gives rise to a requirement of pesticides. These genetically modified grains cannot grow without abundant water. One kilogram of present day rice / wheat requires about 9,000 litres of water to grow. Many dams have come up to cater to the water requirement of Rice and Wheat har vesting. Construction of dams and diversion of the flow of river water is always at a cost to our Ecology and inevitably disrupts the lives of tens of thousands of original dwellers of respective regions, not to speak of the submerging of the flora and disturbance to the habitats of fauna. In addition to this the area around dams become seismically vulnerable. In contrast the Siridhanya (Millets) hardly require about 300 litres of water per kilogram of the grain to be harvested and do well under harsh conditions having minimal rainfall and under scorching sunlight or even draught-like conditions. Since they do not require abundant water like in the case of Rice and Wheat, they require not any pesticides or fertilisers!!\r\nWell. What is the harm in using pesticides or fertilisers to grow grains? It is not natural or organic. Using pesticides and fertilisers to harvest Rice or Wheat results in the grains carrying the residual chemicals. These chemicals also contribute in causing many diseases in our body such as hypertension, diabetes, acidity, cancer, constipation and so on. Rice and wheat contain little fibre. What little it does contain is mostly on its outer layer which is lost during dehusking and polishing. Whereas the Siridhanya (Millets) have fibre through their structure, starting from its centre.\r\nWhy is this fibre so important? The food we consume should get digested slowly resulting in gradual release of glucose into the blood stream. Right fibre content in the food we consume will help make this happen. Since Rice and Wheat have barely any fibre, they release all the glucose in them into our blood stream with in about 15-20 minutes after consumption. There are more than 100 processes for the food we consume to get converted into glucose resulting in providing energy to the body. Since Rice and Wheat have almost no fibre, they get converted into glucose so quickly that the body has no choice but to convert it into glycogen and then into fat resulting in rheumatoid arthritis and triglyceride which end up causing blockade in our blood vessels, in turn requiring angioplasty etc., Millets will release glucose into our blood stream across 5-6 hours or more due to their right fibre content.\r\nOther issues related to wheat and wheat based products :- Wheat is also bleached using a chemical called alloxan and flour produced from this is used as all purpose flour (maida) which in turn is used to prepare many breads such as naan, kulcha, parota, as well as most bakery products and all forms of noodles, pasta, spaghetti etc., This is also the case in the preparation of most branded bakery products including biscuits, sliced bread and other forms of bread etc., Alloxan is a chemical that is used in laboratory on animals such as guinea pigs to create a diabetic condition in them for research purposes. Alloxan kills the beta cells in the pancreas of the animal when injected, resulting in diabetic condition. Wheat also contains a protein called gluten which is harmful to human beings. Also, many people are allergic to gluten.\r\nWhat about meat and eggs? Chicken was a bird rare in nature that was found in very few places like Bali and a few other Southeast Asian countries. Selective domestication of this birds has resulted in growth of its population to about 100 billion today. About 8 kilograms of grains has to be consumed by a chicken to produce a kilogram of meat. This means about 50,000 litres of water is required for 1 kilogram of any meat to reach your plate.\r\nThe industrialization of meat production with the help of steroids and antibiotics has resulted in the animals (chicken, pig, cow, sheep etc) accumulating meat faster than the regular natural growth. This leads to bone and marrow not properly developed in the animals\r\n \r\nresulting in lot of viral diseases to the animals like H1N1, H5N1, Madcow, Dengue, Chikungunya, etc Diseases.\r\nSugar is deadliest of all foods we consume :- Our body is a sugar manufacturing unit in itself. Final step of digestive process is to convert sugar into glucose. The digestive system converts the food we eat into sugar/glucose. The grains, cereals, meat and vegetables we consume are converted by our body into sugar or glucose. This is the energy source for our bodies. There is absolutely no need for us to consume even a milligram of sugar. Which means no ice creams, no chocolates, no birthday cakes, no festival sweet and soft drinks, sweet lassi etc., Even most tooth pastes we use every morning dumps 3 grams of sugar into our body. No wonder children do not feel hungry immediately after brushing their teeth. Food we consume has to undergo more than a hundred steps for sugar/glucose to be produced by the body. When we consume sugar directly the body skips almost all these steps and renders all the organs meant to produce the energy required for the body, useless. Our body requires 30 to 35 gms of sugar which is produced on its own from the food we eat. So what happens to all the sugar we consume directly in the form of sugar and sweets? It causes lots of diseases because body has no choice but to convert such sugar into glycogen leading to rheumatoid arthiritis, triglycerides etc., which lead to blocking of blood vessels which in turn leads to many heart related problems etc., Main objective of producing sugarcane is for liquor industry. Sugar is a byproduct and should not be consumed by human beings.\r\nWater, Plastic and Copper :- Water is a polar molecule. H2O. It is a neutral molecule with both positive and negative sides built into it. Water stored in plastic bottles, regardless of \'food grade plastic\' etc., absorb nano particles of the plastic it is stored in and coat the small intestine with a lining of the plastic it carries when consumed. This makes our intestine hydrophobic (repels water) while the normal nature of our intestine is hydrophilic (to be water friendly). So, sufficient water is not absorbed by our body when water from plastic bottles / containers is consumed by us. Water, stored in copper vessels for 8 hours before consumption is the best. copper is the only material in the world which has free moving d-orbitals due to which electrons move around in the water stored in it and kill all microbes including viruses. Such water is safe for consumption and helps in maintaining good health. Problems including hair fall to constipation are kept in check by adopting such a simple process. Instead of a copper vessel, a mud pot or a steel vessel can be used, but a copper plate (3 cm x 15 cm) should be immersed in the vessel.\r\nUnderstanding the importance of siridhanya (millets) and resisting wheat, paddy rice, sugar, maida based products, bakery products, sweets, meat, eggs and not consuming water stored in plastic containers is the key to keeping modern day diseases at bay.\r\nUSE MILLETS - LIVE HEALTHY\r\nŸConstipation is the cause of all Diseases! The Fibre in Millets counters it !!\r\nŸGrowing & Marketing of Paddy Rice, Wheat, Soya etc., are supported by lobbies with vested interests!

They may be often ignored or thrown away, but you will soon realize just how wonderful they can be.  Fresh tamarind leaves are available only during the spring season, but you can find dried ones all throughout the year in grocery stores. Tamarind leaves are naturally dried under sun to increase their shell life. Tamarind leaves have a sour and tart flavour because of the presence of Vitamin C and tartaric acid. They are known to contain fiber, potassium, iron and even calcium.   Culinary Uses of Tamarind Leaves  Tamarind leaves are used to spice up Asian soups. In countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Philippines, tamarind leaves are often used in seafood dishes to add extra flavour. In Myanmar, they are cooked with the flower buds of tamarind as a delicious veggie.   Tamarind leaves can also be used for garnishing and in salads. You can totally transform your dish by sprinkling these tangy leaves. You can make a quick snack by mixing puffed rice, boiled beans, peanuts, fried onions and some tamarind. It is quick and easy to make and perfect to beat sudden hunger pangs. According to Chef Dhruv Oberoi from Olive Bar and Kitchen in New Delhi, “There are some classic recipes like the ‘Sosatie’ in which fish and prawns are marinated with tamarind juice, garlic, apricot, cumin and chillies and then, we sprinkle some tamarind leaves to give it a whole new flavour.\" \"I\'ve also experimented with a lovely sorbet made with tamarind leaves that has a delicious tangy flavour and can be served as a palate cleanser,\" adds Chef Dhruv.   In South Indian cuisine, many dishes are incomplete without tamarind leaves. It is majorly used in curries, chutneys and rasam. A pickle made with tamarind leaves is very popular in the eastern part of the country. It is considered to be good for digestion as tamarind leaves act as a laxative. In Andhra Pradesh, a special chutney called ‘Chintachiguru pachadi’ is made by adding some fresh or dried tamarind leaves with peanuts, garlic cloves, dried red chilies, and cumin seeds. You can always flavour your favourite yellow dal by adding a cracking tempering of tender tamarind leaves to give it a tinge of sourness.','https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2017-06/tamarind-leaves-imli-patta-herbs_620x350_41498115093.jpg'),(15,'Moringa oleifora / Drumstick Leaves','Moringa oleifera is the most widely cultivated species in the genus Moringa, the only genus in the plant family Moringaceae.

The famous combination with pulichakeerai is Ragi Kali/Ragi Mudde, which once used to be a regular food for the people in villages (since these items are easily available in agricultural forms). In Marathi, it is called Ambaadi (अंबाडी). And is specially prepared to a stew and served to goddess Mahalakshmi/Gauri during the annual festival of Mahalakshmi which falls on three days in between the ten days Ganesha Chaturthi festival in Maharashtra. It is known as Pitwaa in Hindi, Taka bhendi or Khata Palanga in Oriya, Kotrum in Jharkhand Mestapat in Bengali, Amaari in Chhattisgarhi, Pandi/Pundi in Kannada, Anthur in Mizo, Sougri in Manipuri, Sankokda in Punjabi, Aamelli in Chakma, Mwitha in Bodo, Kenaf Leaves in English, and Chin Baung in Chinese. It is a summer crop, and the hotter the place, the more sour the leaf gets.Gongura comes in two varieties, green stemmed leaf and red stemmed. The red stemmed variety is more sour than the green stemmed variety. Gongura is popular in the state of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Manipur, Tripura and also Mizoram. A baby gongura leaf is a full leaf. As the leaf grows older, the leaf splits into four or more parts.￼Other well known recipes made with Gongura as the main ingredient are Gongura pappu (lentils), Gongura mamsam (goat/mutton) and Gongura royyalu(shrimp). In recent times, Gongura Chicken is also being served in restaurants. Gongura and calabash is extremely popular with the Telugu community in South Africa. It is also eaten by Acholi and Lango people in northern Uganda, where it is known as malakwang.In the Bodo Community of Assam too, \'Gongura\' called as \'Mwitha\' is taken very frequently, it is prepared as curry with pork, \'Mwitha-Oma\', with pond fish as \'Mwitha-na\' with prawns as \'Mwitha-nathur\'. The leaves having sour tastes and slippery texture blends easy and makes a wonderful dish with non-veg items. The Bodo community believes that intake of sour helps in fighting the scorching summer heat and prevents illness.','https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Guntur_Gongura1.jpg/440px-Guntur_Gongura1.jpg'),(17,'Piper Betel leaves / Betel Leaves','The betel (Piper betle) is a vine belonging to the Piperaceae family, which includes pepper and kava. Betel leaf is mostly consumed in Asia, and elsewhere in the world by some Asian emigrants, as betel quid or in paan, with Areca nut and/or tobacco.  In India and Sri Lanka a sheaf of betel leaves is traditionally offered as a mark of respect and auspicious beginnings. Occasions include greeting elders at wedding ceremonies, celebrating the New Year, and offering payment to Ayurvedic physicians and astrologers (to whom money and/or areca nut, placed on top of the sheaf of leaves, are offered in thanks for blessings).  The betel plant is an evergreen perennial, with glossy heart-shaped leaves and white catkin. The betel plant originated in South and South East Asia.The betel leaf is cultivated mostly in South and Southeast Asia, from Pakistan[3] to Papua New Guinea.[4] It needs a compatible tree or a long pole for support. Betel requires well-drained fertile soil. Waterlogged, saline and alkali soils are unsuitable for its cultivation.[5]In Bangladesh, farmers called barui[6] prepare a garden called a barouj in which to grow betel. The barouj is fenced with bamboo sticks and coconut leaves. The soil is plowed into furrows of 10 to 15 metres\' length, 75 centimetres in width and 75 centimetres\' depth. Oil cakes, manure, and leaves are thoroughly incorporated with the topsoil of the furrows and wood ash. The cuttings are planted at the beginning of the monsoon season.Proper shade and irrigation are essential for the successful cultivation of this crop. Betel needs constantly moist soil, but there should not be excessive moisture. Irrigation is frequent and light, and standing water should not remain for more than half an hour.Dried leaves and wood ash are applied to the furrows at fortnightly intervals and cow dung slurry is sprinkled. Application of different kinds of leaves at monthly intervals is believed advantageous for the growth of the betel. In 3 to 6 months the vines reach 150 to 180 centimeters in height and they will branch. Harvest begins, with the farmer plucking the leaf and its petiole with his right thumb. The harvest lasts 15 days to one month. Betel plant has made its way to research labs of many Bangladesh chemical and food nutrition companies.The harvested leaves are consumed locally and exported to other parts of Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and the Americas. Betel is grown and cultivated as an important crop in rural Bangladesh.','https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Piper_betle_plant.jpg/440px-Piper_betle_plant.jpg'),(18,'Azadirachta indica / Neem Leaves','Azadirachta indica, commonly known as neem, nimtree or Indian lilac,[2] is a tree in the mahogany family Meliaceae. It is one of two species in the genus Azadirachta, and is native to the Indian subcontinent, i.e. India, Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Maldives. It is typically grown in tropical and semi-tropical regions. Neem trees also grow in islands located in the southern part of Iran. Its fruits and seeds are the source of neem oil.Neem is a fast-growing tree that can reach a height of 15–20 metres (49–66 ft), and rarely 35–40 metres (115–131 ft). It is evergreen, but in severe drought it may shed most of its leaves or nearly all leaves. The branches are wide and spreading. The fairly dense crown is roundish and may reach a diameter of 20–25 metres (66–82 ft). The neem tree is very similar in appearance to its relative, the Chinaberry (Melia azedarach).The opposite, pinnate leaves are 20–40 centimetres (7.9–15.7 in) long, with 20 to 31 medium to dark green leaflets about 3–8 centimetres (1.2–3.1 in) long. The terminal leaflet often is missing. The petioles are short.The (white and fragrant) flowers are arranged in more-or-less drooping axillary panicles which are up to 25 centimetres (9.8 in) long. The inflorescences, which branch up to the third degree, bear from 250 to 300 flowers. An individual flower is 5–6 millimetres (0.20–0.24 in) long and 8–11 millimetres (0.31–0.43 in) wide. Protandrous, bisexual flowers and male flowers exist on the same individual tree.The fruit is a smooth (glabrous), olive-like drupe which varies in shape from elongate oval to nearly roundish, and when ripe is 1.4–2.8 centimetres (0.55–1.10 in) by 1.0–1.5 centimetres (0.39–0.59 in). The fruit skin (exocarp) is thin and the bitter-sweet pulp (mesocarp) is yellowish-white and very fibrous. The mesocarp is 0.3–0.5 centimetres (0.12–0.20 in) thick. The white, hard inner shell (endocarp) of the fruit encloses one, rarely two, or three, elongated seeds (kernels) having a brown seed coat.The neem tree is often confused with a similar looking tree called bakain. Bakain also has toothed leaflets and similar looking fruit. One difference is that neem leaves are pinnate but bakain leaves are twice- and thrice-pinnate.','https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Neem_%28Azadirachta_indica%29_in_Hyderabad_W_IMG_6976.jpg/440px-Neem_%28Azadirachta_indica%29_in_Hyderabad_W_IMG_6976.jpg'),(19,'Ficus religiosa / Peepul Leaves','Ficus religiosa or sacred fig is a species of fig native to the Indian subcontinent[2] and Indochina[3] that belongs to Moraceae, the fig or mulberry family. It is also known as the bodhi tree,[4] pippala tree, peepul tree,[2] peepal tree or ashwattha tree (in India and Nepal).[5] The sacred fig is considered to have a religious significance in three major religions that originated on the Indian subcontinent, Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism. It is the type of tree under which Gautama Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment, and Hindu and Jain ascetics also consider the tree to be sacred and often meditate under them.Ficus religiosa is a large dry season-deciduous or semi-evergreen tree up to 30 metres (98 ft) tall and with a trunk diameter of up to 3 metres (9.8 ft). The leaves are cordate in shape with a distinctive extended drip tip; they are 10–17 centimetres (3.9–6.7 in) long and 8–12 centimetres (3.1–4.7 in) broad, with a 6–10 centimetres (2.4–3.9 in) petiole. The fruits are small figs 1–1.5 centimetres (0.39–0.59 in) in diameter, green ripening to purple.F. religiosa is a tree having a very long lifespan, with an average life ranging between 900–1,500 years. At some of its native habitats, it has been reportedly found living for over 3,000 years.[6] Some trees have been reported to be more than 2,000 years old, like the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, a peepal tree in the ancient city of Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka which is estimated to be more than 2,250 years old and is regarded as the \"Oldest historical tree in the world with religious importance\".[7]Banyans have different male and female trees','https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Ficus_religiosa_Bo.jpg/440px-Ficus_religiosa_Bo.jpg'),(20,'Ocimum sanctum / Holy Basil','Ocimum tenuiflorum (synonym Ocimum sanctum), commonly known as holy basil, tulasi (sometimes spelled thulasi) or tulsi, is an aromatic perennial plant in the family Lamiaceae. It is native to the Indian subcontinent and widespread as a cultivated plant throughout the Southeast Asian tropics.[2][3]  Tulasi is cultivated for religious and traditional medicine purposes, and for its essential oil. It is widely used as a herbal tea, commonly used in Ayurveda, and has a place within the Vaishnava tradition of Hinduism, in which devotees perform worship involving holy basil plants or leaves.  The variety of Ocimum tenuiflorum used in Thai cuisine is referred to as Thai holy basil (Thai: กะเพรา kaphrao);[2] it is not to be confused with Thai basil, which is a variety of Ocimum basilicum. Holy basil is an erect, many-branched subshrub, 30–60 cm (12–24 in) tall with hairy stems. Leaves are green or purple; they are simple, petioled, with an ovate, up to 5 cm (2.0 in)-long blade which usually has a slightly toothed margin; they are strongly scented and have a decussate phyllotaxy. The purplish flowers are placed in close whorls on elongate racemes .[3]The three main morphotypes cultivated in India and Nepal are Ram tulsi (the most common type, with broad bright green leaves that are slightly sweet leaves), the less common purplish green-leaved (Krishna tulasi) and the rare wild \"vana tulsi\". Tulsi leaves are part in the worship of Vishnu and his avatars, including Krishna and Rama, and other male Vaishnava deities, such as Hanuman and some brahmanas. Tulsi is a sacred plant for Hindus and is worshipped as the avatar of Lakshmi.[7] Traditionally, tulsi is planted in the centre of the central courtyard of Hindu houses or may be grown next to Hanuman temples.[8][full citation needed]The ritual lighting of lamps each evening during Kartik includes the worship of the tulsi plant, which is held to be auspicious for the home.[9][10] Vaishnavas traditionally use Hindu prayer beads made from tulsi stems or roots, which are an important symbol of initiation. They have such a strong association with Vaishnavas, that followers of Vishnu are known as \"those who bear the tulsi round the neck\".[11]Tulsi Vivah is ceremonial festival performed anytime between Prabodhini Ekadashi (the eleventh or twelfth lunar day of the bright fortnight of the Hindu month of Kartik) and Kartik Poornima (the full moon of the month).

All parts of the plant are edible, but the fresh leaves and the dried seeds (as a spice) are the parts most traditionally used in cooking.  Most people perceive the taste of coriander leaves as a tart, lemon/lime taste, but a smaller group of about 4–14% of people tested think the leaves taste like bath soap, as linked to a gene which detects aldehyde chemicals present in both.Coriander is native to regions spanning from southern Europe and northern Africa to southwestern Asia. It is a soft plant growing to 50 cm (20 in) tall. The leaves are variable in shape, broadly lobed at the base of the plant, and slender and feathery higher on the flowering stems. The flowers are borne in small umbels, white or very pale pink, asymmetrical, with the petals pointing away from the center of the umbel longer (5–6 mm or 0.20–0.24 in) than those pointing toward it (only 1–3 mm or 0.039–0.118 in long). The fruit is a globular, dry schizocarp 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in) in diameter.<br>EtymologyFirst attested in English in the late 14th century, the word \"coriander\" derives from the Old French: coriandre, which comes from Latin: coriandrum,[4] in turn from Ancient Greek: κορίαννον, koriannon,[5][6] derived from Ancient Greek: κόρις, kóris (a bed bug), and was given on account of its foetid, bed bug-like smell.[7] The earliest attested form of the word is the Mycenaean Greek ko-ri-ja-da-na[8] written in Linear B syllabic script (reconstructed as koriadnon, similar to the name of Minos\'s daughter Ariadne) which later evolved to koriannon or koriandron,[9] and koriander (German).[10]Cilantro is the Spanish word for coriander, also deriving from coriandrum. It is the common term in North American English for coriander leaves, due to their extensive use in Mexican cuisine.[10]','https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/A_scene_of_Coriander_leaves.JPG/440px-A_scene_of_Coriander_leaves.JPG'),(22,'Cactus grandiflorus / Prickly pear Leaves','A cactus (plural: cacti, cactuses, or less commonly, cactus)[3] is a member of the plant family Cactaceae,[Note 1] a family comprising about 127 genera with some 1750 known species of the order Caryophyllales.[4] The word \"cactus\" derives, through Latin, from the Ancient Greek κάκτος, kaktos, a name originally used by Theophrastus for a spiny plant whose identity is not certain.[5] Cacti occur in a wide range of shapes and sizes. Most cacti live in habitats subject to at least some drought. Many live in extremely dry environments, even being found in the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on earth. Cacti show many adaptations to conserve water. Almost all cacti are succulents, meaning they have thickened, fleshy parts adapted to store water. Unlike many other succulents, the stem is the only part of most cacti where this vital process takes place. Most species of cacti have lost true leaves, retaining only spines, which are highly modified leaves. As well as defending against herbivores, spines help prevent water loss by reducing air flow close to the cactus and providing some shade. In the absence of leaves, enlarged stems carry out photosynthesis. Cacti are native to the Americas, ranging from Patagonia in the south to parts of western Canada in the north—except for Rhipsalis baccifera, which also grows in Africa and Sri Lanka.  Cactus spines are produced from specialized structures called areoles, a kind of highly reduced branch. Areoles are an identifying feature of cacti. As well as spines, areoles give rise to flowers, which are usually tubular and multipetaled. Many cacti have short growing seasons and long dormancies, and are able to react quickly to any rainfall, helped by an extensive but relatively shallow root system that quickly absorbs any water reaching the ground surface. Cactus stems are often ribbed or fluted, which allows them to expand and contract easily for quick water absorption after rain, followed by long drought periods. Like other succulent plants, most cacti employ a special mechanism called \"crassulacean acid metabolism\" (CAM) as part of photosynthesis. Transpiration, during which carbon dioxide enters the plant and water escapes, does not take place during the day at the same time as photosynthesis, but instead occurs at night. The plant stores the carbon dioxide it takes in as malic acid, retaining it until daylight returns, and only then using it in photosynthesis. Because transpiration takes place during the cooler, more humid night hours, water loss is significantly reduced.  Many smaller cacti have globe-shaped stems, combining the highest possible volume for water storage, with the lowest possible surface area for water loss from transpiration. The tallest[Note 2] free-standing cactus is Pachycereus pringlei, with a maximum recorded height of 19.2 m (63 ft),[6] and the smallest is Blossfeldia liliputiana, only about 1 cm (0.4 in) in diameter at maturity.[7] A fully grown saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) is said to be able to absorb as much as 200 U.S. gallons (760 l; 170 imp gal) of water during a rainstorm.[8] A few species differ significantly in appearance from most of the family. At least superficially, plants of the genus Pereskia resemble other trees and shrubs growing around them. They have persistent leaves, and when older, bark-covered stems. Their areoles identify them as cacti, and in spite of their appearance, they, too, have many adaptations for water conservation. Pereskia is considered close to the ancestral species from which all cacti evolved. In tropical regions, other cacti grow as forest climbers and epiphytes (plants that grow on trees). Their stems are typically flattened, almost leaf-like in appearance, with fewer or even no spines, such as the well-known Christmas cactus or Thanksgiving cactus (in the genus Schlumbergera).  Cacti have a variety of uses: many species are used as ornamental plants, others are grown for fodder or forage, and others for food (particularly their fruit). Cochineal is the product of an insect that lives on some cacti.','https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51R8i17bs%2BL._SX425_.jpg'),(23,'Rauvolfia serpentine / Serpentine wood Leaves','Rauvolfia serpentina, the Indian snakeroot or devil pepper, is a species of flower in the milkweed family Apocynaceae.[4] It is native to the Indian subcontinent and East Asia (from India to Indonesia).[5][6]  Rauvolfia is a perennial undershrub widely distributed in India in the sub-Himalayan regions up to 1,000 metres (3,300 ft).

They are also used on their own to aromatise a specific type of omelette.[5]Used in Old World beers as flavouring ingredient.','https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Die_Weinraute%2C_lat._Ruta_graveolens%2C_Pflanze_mit_den_gelben_Bl%C3%BCten.jpg/440px-Die_Weinraute%2C_lat._Ruta_graveolens%2C_Pflanze_mit_den_gelben_Bl%C3%BCten.jpg'),(32,'Pridium gnajava / Guava Leaves','Psidium guajava, the common guava,[1] yellow guava,[1] or lemon guava[1] (known as goiaba in Portuguese and guayaba in Spanish) is an evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean, Central America and South America.[1] It is easily pollinated by insects; in culture, mainly by the common honey bee, Apis mellifera.Widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions around the world, guava fruits can range in size from as small as an apricot to as large as a grapefruit. Various cultivars have white, pink, or red flesh, and a few also feature red (instead of green or yellow) skin.When cultivated from seed, guavas are notable for an extremely slow growth rate for several months, before a very rapid acceleration in growth rate takes over. From seed, common guavas may bloom and set fruit in as few as two years or as many as eight. Cuttings and grafting are more commonly used as a propagation method in commercial groves. Highly adaptable, guavas can be easily grown as container plants in temperate regions, though their ability to bloom and set fruit is somewhat less predictable. In some tropical locations, guavas can become invasive. It has become a major problem in the Galápagos Islands.[2]The plant is used in many different shampoo products for its scent. It is also becoming a popular bonsai species and is currently quite popular in India and Eastern Asia.','https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Psidium_guajava_fruit.jpg/440px-Psidium_guajava_fruit.jpg'),(33,'Cocosnucifera oil / Coconut Oil','Coconut Oil, also called Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, is a pale-yellow, semisolid, edible oil.

This review discusses extensively the breakthrough in the utilization of banana by-products such as peels, leaves, pseudostem, stalk and inflorescence in various food and non-food applications serving as thickening agent, coloring and flavor, alternative source for macro and micronutrients, nutraceuticals, livestock feed, natural fibers, and sources of natural bioactive compounds and bio-fertilizers. Future prospects and challenges are the important key factors discussed in association to the sustainability and feasibility of utilizing these by-products. It is important that all available by-products be turned into highly commercial outputs in order to sustain this renewable resource and provide additional income to small scale farming industries without compromising its quality and safety in competing with other commercial products.

INSERT INTO `sd_millet_faq` VALUES (1,'What are Millets?','Millets are small-seeded grasses that are hardy and grow well in dry zones as rain-fed crops, under marginal conditions of soil fertility and moisture. Millets are one of the oldest foods known to humans and possibly the first cereal grain to be used for domestic purposes.\r\nMillets are also unique due to their short growing season. They can develop from planted seeds to mature, ready to harvest plants in as little as 65 days. This is important in heavily populated areas. When properly stored, whole millets will keep for two or more years.\r\n\r\nMillets are traditional grains, grown and eaten in in the indian subcontinent for at least the past 5000 years. They are rain-fed, hardy grains which have low requirements of water and fertility when compared to other popular cereals.\r\nMillets can be split into two broad categories: Naked grains and Husked grains.\r\n“Naked grains” are the three popular millets (Ragi/Finger Millet, Jowar/Sorghum and Bajra/Black Millet) which dont have a hard, undigestable husk. These millets dont need to be processed after harvest – they just need to be cleaned and can be used. Because of this reason, they are still popular in our country and are widely cultivated (they are also called major millets because of this reason).\r\n“Husked grains” are the other millets, like Kodo Millet, Barnyard Millet, Foxtail Millet (navane), Little Millet (saame) and Kodo Millet (haarka), which have an undigestable seed coat. This husk needs to be removed before the grain is fit for human consumption. This used to be done by hand in the centuries past and so was rice. However, the mechanization of the processing of these minor millets did not keep pace with rice and other cereals so they soon became unpopular.','',''),(2,'Why eat millets?','Millets are highly nutritious, rich in fibre and gluten-free, making them easy for the body to absorb. They are rich in a huge spectrum of micronutrients, including calcium, iron, phosphorus, etc. They are slow digestingfoods which don’t cause the huge spike in blood sugar which is caused by eating polished rice, therefore, millets help with preventing and controlling diabetes. Click here for the nutrient composition of millets as compared to wheat and rice.\r\nMillets should ideally be an integral part of your daily diet. They add variety and balance to your food. They can replace white rice in all your meals. You can start by mixing millets into rice and slowly make one meal a day a Millet meal. Some people have found enormous benefits, especially in controlling weight and diabetes, by switching completely from a rice and wheat diet to a millet based diet.\r\n\r\nNutrition:\r\nThey are highly nutritious, non-glutinous and not acid forming foods. Hence they are soothing and easy to digest. They are considered to be the least allergenic and most digestible grains available. Compared to rice, especially polished rice, millets release lesser percentage of glucose and over a longer period of time. This lowers the risk of diabetes\r\nMillets are particularly high in minerals like iron, magnesium, phosphorous and potassium. Finger millet (Ragi) is the richest in calcium content, about 10 times that of rice or wheat. Click here for the nutrient composition of millets as compared to wheat and rice.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental:\r\nUnlike rice and wheat that require many inputs in terms of soil fertility and water, millets grow well in dry regions as rainfed crops. By eating millets, we will be encouraging farmers in dryland areas to grow crops that are best suited for those regions. This is a step towards sustainable cropping practices where by introducing diversity in our diets, we respect the biodiversity in nature rather than forcefully changing cropping patterns to grow wheat and rice everywhere.\r\nSmall farmers:\r\n   There are many co-operatives of small farmers that are working on providing livelihoods to farmers while at the same time focusing on ecological preservation. In dryland regions, these groups encourage the farmers to produce crops that are local to those regions, that thrive best there – millets. By incorporating millets into our diets, we will be supporting these groups. ','',''),(3,'Why are Millets not as popular as rice and wheat?','The green revolution was a landmark initiative to rehaul the agricultural practices of our country. It was launched in response to the multiple famines in the 1950s and 1960s so as to make the country self sufficientwith respect to food production.\r\nThe took a “package” approach – using hybrid variety seeds which have higher yield, adding fertilizers to deal with the additional requirement of this crop, using pesticides and other additives since these hybrid varieties had no defense against local pests and diseases & building dams, supplying electricity, installing borewells and other methods of making sure the crops have sufficient water.\r\nThere picked two cereals as the main force of change: Paddy Rice (Oryza Sativa) and wheat (Triticum aestivum). These two grains were made available to farmers and subsidized heavily to get more farmers to grow these (The whole package was subsidized: fertilizers, pesticides, electricity, etc)\r\nThese initiatives worked remarkably well in making our country produce more food (we produce more than we use now), so well that farmers everywhere switched to growing rice and wheat instead of traditional, hardy cereals like millets. Only the most remote villages and tribes kept to their traditional methods of growing millets and other hardy crops.','',''),(4,'Why are millet nutritious grains when compared to rice, etc?','Grains which grow in harsh conditions store a lot of varied nutrients in their seeds. This is perhaps a symptom of evolutionary pressure – better prepared seeds will survive and thrive and less prepared species will die out. The same benefit is passed on to us as well when we consume it.\r\n\r\nHowever, nowadays, the rice and wheat which we eat are hybrid varieties which have been selected for predictable growth and high yield. By nature, they do not store much nutrients in their seeds.\r\n\r\nIn the same vein, plants which grow on a flourishing rich soil alive with microactivity will get a varied diet to grow on when compared to the plants which grow via hydroponics or soils fed on a steady stream of homogenous fertilisers. This kind of mono-diet for our plants and therefore, our diet, leads to diseases like vitamin deficiency and mineral deficiency.','',''),(5,'Why should the millets be soaked before cooking? What is the benefit? Does it take less cooking time?','Soaking millets decreases phytic acid level. Phytic acid binds minerals in gut and decreases absorption of minerals. Easy to digest and reduces cooking time.','',''),(6,'“Quinoa” – What’s all the fuss?','Quinoa (pronounced ‘keen-wah’) is a pseudo-cereal closely related to our own Dantina Soppu (Amaranthus). Quinoa has been traditionally grown in the highlands of South America as a sustenance crop past 3000 – 4000 years. It caught the fancy of the US public, who are always on the lookout for new “superfoods” – which they think will solve all the problems with their diet. The truth is, we don’t need to look so far as the Southern Andes to find such a nutritious grain. Quinoa, like millets, has evolved in harsh conditions with bad soil & its nutritional profile is comparable to many of the minor millets (especially foxtail, barnyard millets). Why get grains from so far when we have a superfood in our own backyard!','',''),(7,'Can millets be given to babies?','Yes millets can be given to babies. Babies can be fed Popped/malted Millets powder; this is like a millet based substitute for baby food like Cerelac or others. Traditionally, children were given different forms of millets from 6 months up.','',''),(8,'I do not know how to cook millets?','This is a common question people keep asking; first we need to understand that today our common food is Paddy Rice and Wheat.\r\nPaddy belongs to the group of Husked grains – to which other small millets like Foxtail, Little, Kodo, Proso and Barnyard Millets also belong.\r\nWheat belongs to the Group of Naked Grains – to which other millets like Finger millet, Pearl millet and Jowar (Sorghum) belong.\r\nMost people are more familiar with Ragi (Finger Millet), Jowar (Sorghum) and Bajra since these millets are consumed even today in different parts of our country and are a part of the local food culture.\r\nIn the case of husked grains like Paddy we process them in the rice mills to remove the husk and bran to get the conventional white Polished (Paddy) rice.\r\nSimilarly, the 5 different small millets which are husked can also be made into their respective rice forms.\r\nThese grains are less commonly known and are very much like the Paddy rice – so any millet rice can be cooked in the same way as Paddy rice.\r\nThe priority of our nation’s food security programme has bee promotion of rice and wheat. As a result millets, the “miracle grains” have gradually disappeared from the farms and also our diets. The cultural disconnect is too long and has made most of us unfamiliar with these grains to the extent that many of us have not even heard of these grains, leave alone consuming.\r\nMillets can be consumed on a daily basis like any other grain. Chapattis & rice can be made up of millets. Apart from these, millets can be used to make laddus, Dalia and other dishes like – Saama Nippattu, Korra Murukku etc.','',''),(9,'My children do not want to eat millets?','A lot of children do not like porridge made from dalia or oats but learn to like it over a period of time. Taste is cultivated and as parents we have to provide exposure to different textures, flavours etc. Start creating a taste for millets with e.g. laddus made from Popped millets and Millet mixes which can be used as drink by mixing with milk and then introduce it in the form of upma, mix millets in dosa/idli batter thus slowly introducing it into the diet.\r\nA simple Jowar Pop can be very tasty food for the Kids, it is very easy to make and also a nutritious food rich in dietary fiber very essential for building immunity.','',''),(10,'How often can I use millets in our food?','Millets can be consumed on a daily basis. They can either be used as it is or can be mixed with wheat and rice based products.\r\nIn order to get the millets back in to our home, we need to start in stages by using in small percentage in the beginning.\r\nGradually the proportion of millets can be increased. A simple way to begin may be by using millet’s rice along with the Paddy rice (White Rice). One can start with 10% of millets rice mixing and gradually increasing the proportion to 50%. In this way the taste would be retained together with the nutrient benefits of millets. Kids can also be given millets in the form of Ragi biscuits & Bajra chips. Chapattis can be baked using multigrain flour (a kind of flour made by mixing different varieties of millets).\r\nPure millets rice, millet idlis, pongal, pulao, khichdiCurd rice, Dosa, Idly, Puttu etc. can all be made with millets.','',''),(11,'Are Millets  hard to digest?','This is a misconception. For e.g. when one shifts from white, polished rice to unpolished rice the quantity of rice that you need to eat to feel satiated is much less since the unpolished rice has more bran and has a lower glycaemic index. As a result you feel hungry much later than you would with white, polished rice. In the same manner, the high fibre content of millets leads to slower digestion and a lower glycaemic index. Once one understands the nature of millets, one will find that much less quantities of millets are required to get the same amount of energy to keep us working. This is also why millets are excellent for diabetics.\r\nMillets do not contain any gluten, a wheat protein that is hard for the human body to digest. Consequently, they are NOT acid-forming foods and are easy to digest. More on gluten here.','',''),(12,'Won’t using millets be more expensive compared to Paddy rice or Wheat?','Millets have been known as poor people’s/hard working people’s food. Not all Millets are costly. Millets like Ragi and Bajra are comparatively cheaper and even today they are commonly consumed by the people in the form of Mudda (Kali) or Roti.\r\nMillet products are comparatively more expensive than paddy rice or wheat because the millet grains are small and hence more difficult to process compared to Paddy. Indian Government has invested extensively in Paddy cultivation and processing and as a result cost of processing is low. In the case of millets Government investment on processing and promotion has been minimal, but has increased by 25%. Traditionally people processed millets manually but this was impossible if one wanted to make millets available to a larger section of the population. With increased investment, the processing will get cheaper on larger volumes, there by reducing the cost as well.\r\nIn the final analysis remember that for every kg of paddy rice / wheat you will need significantly lower quantities of millets. As a result there is a savings on the cost. In addition the hidden cost of reduction in medical expenses and improved health will lead to more value for the money that you spend on your food.','',''),(13,'I do not have Diabetes, why should I take millets?','Millets are highly nutritious, non-glutinous and not acid forming food. Hence they’re soothing and easy to digest. They’re considered to be least allergenic & most digestible grains available.\r\nDiabetes and other chronic diseases are known to have close link to the food that we consume.','',''),(14,'Can millets be as tasty as the food cooked from Rice and Wheat?','Yes. Millets have been used to make tasty recipes like – Ragi cake, Bajra muffins, ragi pancakes, millet porridge & Malayali style puttu. Bajra-Jowar bread is known to be very delicious and is the fastest selling bread at many bakeries across the country.','',''),(15,'Isn’t cooking millets more time consuming and difficult?','Millets are very much like any other commonly used grain; they can be cooked in the same forms as we cook the paddy rice or Wheat.','',''),(16,'How do I know which millet I should eat?','Food and food habits are shaped by where you live. The easiest answer to this question is, like in the case of vegetables and fruits, eat millets that are local to your area.','',''),(17,'What are the health benefits of eating millets?','Millets are highly nutritious, non-glutinous and not acid forming food. Hence they’re soothing and easy to digest.\r\nNormally this feeling is due to the fact that Millets, owing to complex carbohydrates, keep us full for a long period of time unlike the Paddy rice (contain simple carbohydrates). Millets release glucose in to blood gradually without over loading with sudden surge of glucose like the White rice.\r\nEating millets will not only reduce your weight but will also give you the nutritional benefits which rice and wheat won’t provide. They’re considered to be least allergenic & most digestible grains available.','',''),(18,'Can pregnant women consume millets?','Certainly they can consume millets. In fact, millets are ideal for pregnant mothers since several of them like ragi and bajra are rich in iron and calcium. The mothers who are having gestational diabetes should use millets in place of other grains; this will help control the problem.\r\nUse of millets will help build immunity to the baby growing in the womb.\r\n','',''),(19,'Millets are generally used as Bird feed. Can humans eat the same kind of millets?\r\n','Birds intuitively know the nutrition in the millets, they mainly eat the unprocessed whole grains. Millets are the preferred food by pet birds instead of paddy and wheat. The people who keep pet birds will be familiar with the millets grains they purchase for them. It is a paradox that it is here in the bird feed shops that these grains are available.\r\nToday one of the largest demands for the millets is for the bird feed market. This often has created a mindset that these grains are for the birds and not for human consumption.\r\nHumans can use the same millets after the required processing of dehusking just as in paddy.','',''),(20,'Who all can use millets?','Anybody from new born babies to youngsters to adults to elderly people can consume millets. People who are healthy, sick, poor, rich, men, women and of social status can consume the millets the way we use Paddy and Wheat.','',''),(21,'How does consuming millets help protect the environment?','Unlike rice and wheat that require many inputs in terms of soil fertility & water, millets grow well in dry regions as rain-fed crops. Consuming millets will support sustainable cropping practice whereby introducing diversity in our diets. Hence, there is no agro-ecological conflict.','',''),(22,'How beneficial are millets  for athletes?','Carbohydrates are important for athletes as it is a major source of energy for them. Millets are the only source of carbohydrates which does not have any starch in it and they release energy slowly allowing for improved stamina during long periods of intense activity.','',''),(23,'If millets are so beneficial why aren’t they as prevalent as rice and wheat?','<img src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/0d315f_f44741367b7e4feaa0b0010e351face1~mv2.png\" alt=\"Smiley face\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"/>\r\n\r\nThe Green revolution introduced by the govt in 1960 gave thrust to enhancing the production and promotion of Paddy and Wheat all over the country. Huge investments were made for creating a large infrastructure at the national level to enable the farmers to produce these two crops. ICAR, FCI, Ministry of Agriculture, Department of civil supplies were established to provide all the necessary technical and logistics support.\r\nThe subsequent Rs.2/kg paddy scheme and subsidies given to the farming of paddy and wheat in the name of national food security changed India’s eating and farming habits irrevocably. Today, policy and agricultural experts blame that single act for wiping out 85% of India’s millet farming.\r\nSocially, millets were the food of the so-called lower classes. In the history of Post independent India it was unfortunate that millets did not receive suitable attention or support. When the green revolution was launched, the decision makers ignored the fact that millet, not paddy, was the rice of the middle-class Indian. It is an inherent caste system in food. It has been referred to as racism in food, where anything white like polished rice and refined flour is treated as superior even though it’s deadly for diet, and grains that are dark are put down as inferior.\r\nWith the way we have promoted our foods, today the cultivation, processing and marketing of these grains are less common to find.\r\nGradually situation is changing; people understand the value of millets which we have forgotten. There is increasing demand for the millets now, it is more common to find Ragi and other millets products in the market.','',''),(24,'What kinds of millets are available?','Barnyard Millet (Hindi: Jhangora or Madira; Tamil: Kuthiravaali; Telugu: Odalu)\r\nFinger Millet (Hindi: Mandua; Tamil: Kelvargu; Telugu: Ragulu; Kannada: Ragi; Malayalam: Koovarugu)\r\nFoxtail Millet (Hindi: Kangni; Tamil: Tenai; Telugu: Korra; Kannada: Navane; Malayalam: Thina)\r\nKodo Millet (Hindi: Kodra; Tamil: Varagu; Telugu: Arikelu; Kannada: Harka)\r\nLittle Millet (Hindi: Kutki; Tamil: Samai; Telugu: Sama; Kannada: Same; Malayalam: Chama)\r\nPearl Millet (Hindi: Bajra, Tamil: Kambu, Telugu: Gantilu, Kannada: Sajje)\r\nProso Millet (Hindi: Barri; Tamil: Panivaragu; Telugu: Varigulu; Kannada: Baragu)\r\nSorghum (Hindi: Jowar; Tamil: Cholam; Telugu: Jonna; Kannada: Jola; Malayalam: Cholum)','',''),(25,'How do I cook them?','\r\nMost millets can be cooked like rice. Millets can replace rice in various dishes such as idli, dosa, payasam/kheer. Millet flour can be used to make rotis.
